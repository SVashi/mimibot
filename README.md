Just a proof of concept and as such will be buggy! In order to test this out on your server, please find the channel id of the channel 
(https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) and then replace the number after the
equals sign with your own channel id. Will be upscaled to work on every channel and this fix can be done in less than 15 minutes.
