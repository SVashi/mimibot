Just a proof of concept and as such will be buggy! In order to test this out on your server, please find the channel id of the channel 
(https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) and then replace the number after the
equals sign with your own channel id. Will be upscaled to work on every channel and this fix can be done in less than 15 minutes. 

Hosts can start raids with !setRaid raidname, and users use !queue to queue up for the raid. There is a seperate queue for each channel that is manually set in the code. !startRaid gets people from the queue a link code they can all use with the host. The host can grab an extra person if they believe there is a no show, who gets the same link code. The host can end the raid once they are done with the raid as well.
